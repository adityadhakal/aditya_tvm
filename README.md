Instructions for recreating the Error 
=====================================
- First back-up your existing files
- replace the measure_methods.py file located in `tvm_root/python/tvm/autotvm/measure` with one found in this repository
- compile the TVM by following cmd arguments `cd python; python setup.py install --user; cd ..`
- Run any client example.

For server side:
- A C++ RPC server should be located in `tvm_root/apps/cpp_rpc` It can be compiled to generate a executable server.
- Run a C++ RPC server with following commands replacing the IP address and port with right IP address and port `./tvm_rpc server --host=192.168.0.90 --port=9000 --port-end=9090 --tracker=192.168.0.20:9190 --key=v100`

Running the experiment
Run any client example from client node.
Logs should soon show the errors in both client and server side

Apache TVM (incubating) is a compiler stack for deep learning systems. It is designed to close the gap between the
productivity-focused deep learning frameworks, and the performance- and efficiency-focused hardware backends.
TVM works with deep learning frameworks to provide end to end compilation to different backends.

Acknowledgement
---------------
We learned a lot from the following projects when building TVM.
- [Halide](https://github.com/halide/Halide): Part of TVM's TIR and arithmetic simplification module
  originates from Halide. We also learned and adapted some part of lowering pipeline from Halide.
- [Loopy](https://github.com/inducer/loopy): use of integer set analysis and its loop transformation primitives.
- [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano): the design inspiration of symbolic scan operator for recurrence.
